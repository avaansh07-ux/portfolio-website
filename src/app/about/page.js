      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I'm Avaansh Nanda, a Computing and Financial Management student at the Univeristy of Waterloo. 
        Welcome to my page! Feel free to look around and find some of the ideas I have and turn them 
        into real projects, learning fast along the way.

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Outside of school, I’m big on staying active. I love working out, and I grew up playing 
        hockey, basketball, and soccer. I also enjoy traveling and exploring new places whenever I 
        get the chance.
